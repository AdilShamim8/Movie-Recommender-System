# Movie Recommender System

A Movie Recommender System that leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. This project includes data preprocessing, model building, and a web interface for interacting with the recommendations.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation engine using a dataset of movies. The system explores various approaches such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest movies tailored to individual user preferences. The primary components include:

- **Dataset:** Contains raw data and preprocessing notebooks.
- **Model:** Scripts and notebooks for building and training recommendation algorithms.
- **Website:** A web interface that allows users to input their preferences and view recommendations.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Generate movie suggestions based on user input and historical data.
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze movie datasets using Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Model Training:** Experiment with different recommendation algorithms.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** A simple website to interact with the recommender system.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized codebase to easily update or expand functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Make sure you have Python installed.
- **pip:** Python package manager.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For running and exploring the notebooks.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdilShamim8/Movie-Recommender-System.git
   cd Movie-Recommender-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Install the required Python packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

#### Running the Notebooks

- Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data preprocessing and model training:

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```

- Navigate to the appropriate notebook in the `Dataset/` or `Model/` folder.

#### Starting the Web Interface

- Navigate to the `Website/` directory and start the web application (this may vary depending on the framework used, e.g., Flask, Django, or Streamlit). For example, we using Streamlit:

  ```bash
  cd Website
  Streamlit run app.py
  ```

- Open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the port specified) to interact with the recommender system.

## Customization

You can modify the recommendation logic, explore different algorithms, or adjust the web interface as needed. The code is modular and documented, so extending functionality or experimenting with new approaches is straightforward.
